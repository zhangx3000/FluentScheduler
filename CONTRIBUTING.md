**Opening issues**

When opening an issue, make sure to include the version of the library that you're using and, if possible, to provide a reproducible example.

Also, if it's related to any of the topics below, join the existing issue instead of opening a new one:

* ASP.NET? See [#270](https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler/issues/270).
* Dependency injection? See [#271](https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler/issues/271).
* UI threads (Windows Forms, WPF, ActiveX, etc)? See [#272](https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler/issues/272).

**Submitting pull requests**

When making a pull request, make sure to discuss it first in an issue. If it's a new feature, make sure it has a clear use case and play nice with existing features. 

We're cautious (and picky) about any changes to the codebase. When doing so, following its structure and code style is a must.
